                    <p>MyTopSongs is a tool that uses spotfy's api to display a users' top 10 songs
                        from the last month, 6 months and all-time. It was inspired by 'receiptify'
                        a popular tool to display a user's spotify statistics in a reciept format.
                        It can be found <a href="https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/">here.</a></p>

                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                    <p>This project's code uses the open source spotify api to grab listening data
                        from users and report their top songs. Unfortunately, with the data available,
                        I'm limited to only the last month, half year and all time. I don't know how
                        spotify stores any of this data.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How was it made?</h2>
                    <p>This project's code uses python for the backend, mainly using the tool 'spotipy'
                        to simplify the data retrieving and authorization process. HTML templates to display
                        the necessary data, CSS for styling and Javascript for interactivity. The code can
                        be found <a href="https://github.com/avajian/Spotify-Stats">here.</a>

                    <p>I'm hoping to get it hosted somewhere so it can be used and accessed anywhere.
